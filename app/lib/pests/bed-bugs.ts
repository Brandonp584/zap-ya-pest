  intro: [
    "Bed bugs are a growing problem across the Moreton Bay region, Sunshine Coast, and Bribie Island, affecting homes, hotels, apartments, and short-term accommodation.",
    "These tiny, blood-feeding insects hide in mattresses, bed frames, furniture, and cracks in walls, making them difficult to detect until an infestation is well established. Bed bugs are not a sign of poor hygiene and are commonly introduced through luggage, clothing, or second-hand furniture.",
    "Our professional bed bug control services are designed to completely eliminate infestations by targeting both visible bugs and hidden harbourage areas, ensuring long-term protection and peace of mind."

    "Early detection and professional treatment are critical to preventing widespread infestations.",
    "Bed bugs can infest even the cleanest homes, hotels, and accommodation properties across Moreton Bay, the Sunshine Coast, and Bribie Island."
