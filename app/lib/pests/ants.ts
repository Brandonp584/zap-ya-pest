    "Small but highly persistent, ants can quickly invade kitchens, bathrooms, gardens, and living spaces as they search for food, moisture, and shelter.",

  overview: [
    "Ants are social insects that live in large colonies and work together to forage, build nests, and protect their queen.",
    "Some ant species can carry up to 50 times their own body weight and travel long distances while searching for food sources.",
    "There are over 15,000 ant species worldwide, with more than 1,400 species found in Australia.",
    "While ants play an important ecological role, infestations inside homes and businesses can quickly become a nuisance and health concern.",
    "In the Moreton Bay and Sunshine Coast regions, several ant species are known for invading homes, gardens, and commercial properties."
